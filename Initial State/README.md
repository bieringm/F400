# Inital State of the F400

This machine was originally bought to manufacture fixturing in an aerospace manufacturing company. After breaking down a few times, the company left it on the manufacturing floor for a few years before I was able to pic it up. There is a fair bit of slug and other oil that has collected on the machine from sitting out in the facility.

This is to document the starting condition of this project.

As is apparent, the hotend needs to be replaced completely. I am not 100% sure if I will replace it with another V6 or something else.
