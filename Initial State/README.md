# Inital State of the F400

This machine was originally bought to manufacture fixturing in an aerospace manufacturing company. After breaking down a few times, the company left it on the manufacturing floor for a few years before I was able to pic it up. There is a fair bit of slug and other oil that has collected on the machine from sitting out in the facility.

This is to document the starting condition of this project.
