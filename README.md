# F400-M
Fusion3 F400-S Modifications/Build Log

This Repo is to document and assist with modifications to my Fusion3 F400-S, what I am calling a F400-M. The current plan is to upgrade from the stock Duet board to a BTT Octopus Max EZ with the EZ2209 Drivers and use the belt conversion from TFD42 on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5592406). The printer will also be run using Klipper.
